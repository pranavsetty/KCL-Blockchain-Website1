            <h1>Q&A with Dovetail Digital</h1>
            <h4>February 23, 2018 </h4>

            <h4>Interviewer: Saul Asghar / Interviewee: William Nash</h4>


            <b>1. Why are you interested in blockchain?<b>


            <p>Blockchains and distributed ledger technology sit at an intersection between the cutting edge of computer
            science and the needs of business and real consumers. This allows the exploration of problems that are both
            theoretical and practical; it’s perfect for someone with a wide set of interests. I studied Physics and
            Philosophy at King’s and enjoyed both subjects; I like being able to solve problems in different ways.</p>


            <p>I’m excited to be in a company where we’re using distributed ledgers to solve a problem which is important
                and blockchain-relevant.</p>


                <b>2. Why were you drawn towards blockchain in healthcare?</b>


            <p>Fundamentally, the NHS is a distributed organisation. It appears centralised at first glance but
            information, decision making and patient services are all highly distributed geographically and
            organisationally. It’s also very event driven. Since most patients get better, there is a natural flow
            through the system; a patient enters, has tests followed by treatment and then leaves the system. These two
            factors (distributed and event driven) mean that healthcare in the UK is full of potential applications for
                blockchains.</p>


            <p>I personally was drawn to this work while working on our proof of concept for medical records on the
            blockchain. I broke my arm and, after I left A&E, had to return for surgery days later. By then, they’d
            already lost my records and we had to recreate them from memory; that really intensified my interest in our
                work!</p>


                <b>3. Tell us about the work Dovetail Digital is conducting in regards to blockchain?</b>


            <p>We are a health tech company empowering the secure and accountable sharing of medical data, using
            blockchain, that patients and practitioners want. We aim to ensure that when people use any health and
            wellbeing service that practitioners have the up to date and accurate information they need to improve
                health.</p>


            <p>We use a version our distributed ledger to immutably save data sharing events. Each clinic or clinic cluster
            can see the transactions they are party to and we can perform real-time auditing of events or 'deep dives'
                into past events.</p>


                <b>4. What does the future hold for blockchain in healthcare?</b>


            <p>Globally there have been fantastic developments which are hugely promising and we’re keeping a keen eye on
                those developments. For Dovetail the future is growth and adoption.</p>


            <p>For Dovetail over the coming months, we’re going to launch our product and steadily on-board more and more
            electronic health records (EHR) systems and clinicians. The adoption of data standards will assist our work
            and allow us to focus exclusively on the blockchain parts of our application. We’re proud to have received
            funding from NHS England as this is an amazing signal from the NHS that they’re embracing digital change and
                share our vision of a technology-enabled accountable healthcare system.</p>
