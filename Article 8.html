            <h1>
                Could Block-Technology allow Putin to Regain the Trust of Western Democracies?</h1>
            <h4>March 15, 2018</h4>

            <h4>Sophie Piaget</h4>

            <p>Russia currently finds itself in various scandals involving meddling, corruption, and hacking. Whether it be
            its potential involvement in the US elections, poisoning an exiled spy, or doping athletes, Vladimir Putin’s
                empire has completely lost the trust of Western democracies.</p>


            <p>Blockchain, on the other hand, runs on the promise of making the world’s transactions safer and more
            transparent. Despite their fairly opposite attributes Russia and blockchain have, quite astonishingly, come
            together to promote democracy in the post-Soviet state’s political affairs.</p>


           <b>The question therefore becomes: Could block-technology allow Putin to regain the trust of Western
               democracies?</b>


            <p>Despite Putin’s initial reluctance to the emergence of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, proclaiming them as
            dangerous and related to criminal activity, he has recently acquired a taste for them. February 2018 marked
            the first Russian coalition between a state-governed bank and a blockchain-based payment system.
            Vneshconombank and the government of Kaliningrad welcomed blockchain in an effort to improve the efficiency
                of their management decisions and increase transparency in the region’s business transactions.</p>


            <p>Block-technology was used by Moscow, earlier this year, to help its population vote on the make-up of their
            city. The Active Ciziten program, partnered with ethereum-technology, has seen a growing number of votes
            since blockchain was introduced. The name of Moscow’s new metro line and the colour of the seats in their
            new stadium are examples of the many decisions that were made through this platform. Although these votes
            may seem banal, they underline Russia’s willingness to acknowledge its troubled reputation, and find
                solutions in one of the world’s newest technological waves.</p>


            <p>The country has recently taken it a step further with the All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion
            (VTsIOM) announcing that “exit polls VTsIOM at the presidential elections in Russia-2018 will be held with
                the use of block-technologies”. This is revolutionary for blockchain and Russian democracy alike.</p>


            <p>In the past, VTsIOM has had to shut its website down during elections as it was under the constant threat of
            Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and anonymous hackers. This year, however, they will be
            partnering with local start-up 2chain to make sure that exit polls are delivered to the public in the most
            data secure way possible. The City of Moscow also employed accounting firm PwC to run trials to ensure data
            could not be manipulated by internal employees or external attacks. The research was conclusive and showed
            that as long as the poll had over 300,000 votes there should be no security concerns. Despite this being a
            positive point for future endeavours it is important to note that the current figures only stand at an
                approximate 137,000 to 220,000 participation-rate.</p>


            <p>Despite the ground-breaking nature of this project, there is still some scepticism surrounding the idea that
                blockchain could move Russia into a more honest and democratic phase.</p>


            <p>Although blockchain will ensure that the exit polls are not changed once recorded, it still requires the
            data to be correctly gathered in the first place. Additionally, individuals might find it daunting and
            discouraging to disclose their vote to a state-owned institution. Subsequently, this could cause a
            substantial number of voters to give inaccurate answers at exit polls, or simply place further pressure on
                them to vote for Putin.</p>


            <p>Regardless, in a time where Russia is associated with everything but democracy, the idea of it being one of
            the first nations to push for such assured transparency is pleasantly surprising. As unconvinced as you may
            be in block-technology’s power to restore the West’s faith in Russia’s political legitimacy, it would be
                unjust to not appreciate this political move as a positive step towards better international relations.</p>
