            <h1>An Exploration of our Modern Notion of Liberty through Blockchain</h1>
            <h4>February 12, 2018 | Hugo D'Arcy</h4>

            <p>In this article I will be looking at two aspects of Blockchain. The first is seeing how Blockchain helps
                develop and reinforce Benjamin Constant’s notion of the liberty of the modern man (or liberty of the
                Moderns). The second is discussing how Blockchain maintains legal integrity. This will be argued via
                David
                Hume’s notions of artificial virtues and public utility that are so important in our modern society.</p>


            <p>To give a quick background on Constant, he was a key thinker in the Early-French School of Liberalism.
                One
                of his most influential papers was on the difference between what Liberty meant to the Ancients, and
                what it
                meant to the Moderns (Constant was writing in the 19th century). Constant argued that Liberty to the
                Moderns
                is:</p>

            <ul>

                <li>The right to be subject to laws and not to be subject to the decisions of an individual or class;
                </li>
                <li>The right of opinion and expression, to choose one’s profession and practise it;</li>
                <li>Freedom of movement in regards to one’s own agency;</li>
                <li>The right to associate with other individuals, be it in a religious or business sense; and</li>
                <li>The right to influence government.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Whereas liberty for the Ancients – Constant argues – is more like collective freedom rather than
                individual
                liberty (as we define it today), in that, in order to survive the collective had to be put ahead of the
                individual, the luxury of the Moderns is that personal freedom facilitates the development of the
                abstract
                notions of commerce. Most importantly, the Moderns’ development of individual liberty allowed for mutual
                benefit in the face of adversity (through trade), where the Ancients – through warfare – had to endure
                either a win or a loss. Constant put forth the idea that liberty is being allowed to pursue one’s own
                agendas, without hurting those of others, be it religious, political or economic. Given this as a
                starting
                point, I want to explore how Blockchain develops an individual’s personal economic liberty, as
                conceptualised by Constant’s idea of the Moderns.</p>


            <p>The main way that Blockchain can develop our personal economic liberty is how it manages cross-border and
                cross-currency payments. As it stands the most popular/common way of making payments between countries
                is
                SWIFT payments. SWIFT stands for ‘Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications.’ It is
                in
                effect a network of institutions that process payments via a messaging network. In this article I will
                not
                be looking at the financial gain/losses of Blockchain compared to SWIFT, but rather looking at the
                personal
                benefits. In a single SWIFT payment the following members need to be involved: payer, payer’s bank,
                payer’s
                bank’s correspondent, beneficiary bank’s correspondent, beneficiary bank, beneficiary. In addition, a
                SWIFT
                payment can take between 3-5 days to process, this is due to the time it takes to message both banks and
                all
                the measures and counter-measures needed to validate the payment; sometimes this takes longer if the
                bank
                floats the money that needed to be transferred. Thus, individuals are limited in their personal economic
                liberty in light of their transactions taking around 3-5 days, the banks potentially floating the
                individual’s money at the gain of the bank and the information of the individual it shares with all the
                members listed above.</p>


            <p>On the other hand Blockchain does not impose these limitations on an individual’s personal economic
                liberty.
                Firstly the transaction on a Blockchain is done instantaneously, thus, the individual does not have to
                wait
                for the plethora of messaging and checks to be done on their transactions, as such the money can be
                transferred that day. Therefore, an individual’s personal economic freedom is augmented since their
                money is
                not held by financial institutions and can be sent around the world as they wish. Second, since an
                individual’s information and data is not passed around the various institutions of the SWIFT payment
                service
                (with a Blockchain all parties are tied into a ‘Block transaction’ within the chain), all parties can
                see
                the relevant data of the transaction. Additionally, all documents that get added to the Block get added
                in
                real-time and all relevant parties are able to see it, it’s all rather transparent. No party is able to
                withhold information relevant to the Block otherwise the transaction won’t go through and no party is
                allowed to change any of the data since it’s protected behind a security wall that is maintained by the
                distributive ledger.</p>


            <p>However, the issue that has plagued one of the largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, is legal integrity. As
                Jamie Bartlett discusses in his TED talk on the Dark Web, Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are used
                to
                facilitate illegal transactions, i.e. drugs. The reason being that users maintain their anonymity in
                these
                transactions. This obviously makes it difficult for companies and states to trust such a system and make
                business deals through it. Going against the law and legal integrity would also attack several other
                modern
                notions of our society, including the notion of contracts, agreements and conventions. The famed
                Scottish
                philosopher David Hume’s puts forth several notions:</p>


            <ul>

                <li>Artificial social virtues, these virtues arise out of social convention examples are – justice,
                    promise-keeping and fidelity – their benefit does not come from a single action. Rather, it comes
                    from all
                    agents within a society upholding them and incorporating them into the society’s system. In that,
                    agents
                    maintaining the artificial virtue of promise-keeping will have the consequence that bank loans and
                    legally
                    binding contracts have a value within the society.
                </li>

                <li>Natural virtues, self-love and benevolence, are instinctive traits that humans possess that arise
                    from our
                    intellects.
                </li>

                <li>Public utility requires property rights to have inflexible rules that benefit the public. So as to
                    make sure
                    that our modern society has contracts and agreements that are abided by. One such piece of property
                    would be
                    crypto-currencies.
                </li>

            </ul>

            <p>Additionally, Hume states that: “the good of mankind is the only object of all these law and obligations”
                (Hume, Enquires concerning Human understanding p.192). Thus, justice and property rights are there for
                the
                benefit of society, with laws being their safeguard. Bitcoin’s history with the dark web makes it
                extremely
                difficult for Bitcoin to be part of these inflexible rules that allow for public utility; especially for
                the
                artificial virtues of promise keeping and fidelity to be upheld. As it wishes to actively go against the
                laws of most countries, thereby, making it unsuitable for companies and states to use since it goes
                against
                the purpose of what Hume argues to be the good of laws and obligations, being for the benefit of
                mankind.</p>


            <p>Thus, keeping a promise or contract is a modern notion that is necessary to keep social convention, much
                like the notion of liberty, we would need to uphold both Constant’s notion of liberty and Hume’s
                artificial
                virtues/public utility if we want to hold Blockchain as heralding our modern ideals. This is where the
                use
                of embedded logical programmes that create ‘Smart Contracts’ come into play. Since Blockchain is
                append-only
                (meaning that you can only add to a block) the smart contract programme computes the set of rules within
                the
                parameters of the information it is given. Therefore, Smart Contracts help uphold the artificial virtues
                of
                contracts and public utility, which are so pivotal to our system of law (in Hume’s eyes) through the
                software within the Distributive Ledger of the Blockchain. Furthermore, having these Blockchain and
                smart
                contracts enables us to update the banking system so that the private information of individuals is not
                spread to a plethora of institutions that individuals do not want to possess their information, as well
                as,
                developing a secure and legally integral way of implementing a new form of property right and fiscal
                asset,
                being crypto-currencies.</p>


            <p>In conclusion, Blockchain has, within its systems, methods of developing an individual’s personal
                economic
                liberty and maintaining legal integrity. As Constant articulated, liberty to the Moderns is the right of
                association and the freedom to be left to one’s own devices, thus, not having several financial
                institutions
                know your personal data and potentially hold onto your money would go against this. Furthermore, making
                deals transparent to all parties involved to build trust and not going against notions of the legal
                foundations of our modern society further advances Blockchain’s potential to be of social benefit. For,
                crypto-currencies are a new form of property that need to uphold the standards that other forms of
                property
                have, in order to be able to help our economic development and further reinforce our personal economic
                liberty.</p>
