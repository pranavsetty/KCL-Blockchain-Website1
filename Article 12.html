<h1>Q&A with Dovetail Digital</h1>
<h4>March 19, 2018</h4>

<h4>Saul Asghar, Shreya Chawla, Elizabeth Tiffany, Yves Vancraenendonck</h4>

<p>Globally, healthcare systems are in need of reform. From frequent data hacks to blatant inefficiencies in
    patient care, blockchain can provide an effective solution to the inefficiencies currently present in the
    healthcare sector. However, despite the incredible potential that such a technology can bring to healthcare,
    there lies a huge amount of development for the advantageous properties of blockchain to be realised.</p>


<p>So what are issues with current healthcare systems, and how can blockchain provide an answer to these
    inefficiencies? It is these questions that this article will seek to explore, and shed light on the
    application of blockchain within the healthcare sector.</p>


<b>1 - Current inefficiencies in the healthcare sector?</b>

<br>

<b>1.1 - The centralised management of health records</b>


<p>An Electronic Health Record (EHR) is the systematised collection of patient and population health
    information electronically stored in a digital format. This eliminates that need for storage via
    ‘old-fashioned’ paper documentation. Although it is widely implemented in healthcare organisations, it is
    also often a source of great frustration.</p>


<p>This is primarily because currently EHRs are stored on centralised databases in which medical data remains
    largely non-portable. Health data contained in legacy systems is siloed and difficult to share with others
    because of varying formats and standards. To address this issue of interoperability, several international
    standards for transfer of clinical and administrative data between software applications used by various
    healthcare providers have been promoted. These attempts to standardise have not accomplished their goals, as
    this requires the collaboration between different EHR vendors who are not keen as data has become more of a
    commodity and competitive advantage than a basis for coordinated care.</p>


<b>1.2 - Healthcare quality</b>


<p>The patient’s quality of care suffers as a result of this fragmented healthcare data landscape. As there are
    still different health records with assorted healthcare providers, institutions are not aware of a patient’s
    complete history and may rely on out-dated health information. Patients with complex chronic diseases can
    see up to 5 or 10 specialty departments. This could lead to incorrect decision-making, delays, and
    unnecessary costs for the patient. Medical errors are the third leading cause of death, and most of these
    represent systemic problems, including poorly coordinated care.</p>


<b>1.3 - Inaccessibility</b>


<p>Presently, patients do not have control over the access privileges to their medical records. Patient
    engagement is an increasingly important component of strategies to reform health care. There is considerable
    evidence indicating the benefits of providing patients with access to their health information. Engaged
    patients have higher levels of satisfaction, and improved health and outcomes, have increased levels of
    trust of in their physicians and results in a reduction in overall expenditure. For this, it is essential
    that patients can access their own health information, enabling them to be the ‘source of control’ in making
    healthcare decisions.</p>


<b>1.4 - Security and privacy issues</b>


<p>A substantial amount of data is retrieved from biomedical imaging, laboratory testing and omics data.
    Although increased data volume and complexity offers new exciting perspectives in healthcare industry
    development, it also introduces new challenges in privacy and security. Lack of adequate security measures
    has resulted in numerous data breaches. Recently, an attack caused by the WannaCry ransomware shut down work
    at 16 hospitals across the United Kingdom. Therefore it is not a surprise that patients are becoming
    increasingly anxious about the privacy of their medical records. As centralisation increases the security
    risk footprint, and requires trust in a single authority, the question is raised whether healthcare data
    should be trusted in the hands of third-parties.</p>


<b>1.5 - Tampering with data</b>


<p>Although healthcare is very much based on evidence, there is a general lack of confidence in its sources.
    The bad science in clinical trials has been well documented and includes selective publication of positive
    results, performing unplanned analyses and changing the outcomes that were pre-specified at the beginning of
    the clinical trial. There is need for open science and open data, in which the trial protocol, pre-specified
    hypotheses, and raw data are made available. Today, companies that want to perform a clinical trial are
    required to register their trial on ClinicalTrials.gov. However, compliance is poor, with only 13% of
    clinical trials being registered within two years. Besides, only limited information needs to be published.</p>


<p>Altering or removing information in a patient record, e.g. to correct a mistake, is common practice for
    healthcare providers. Nevertheless, to pass off a rewritten record as contemporaneous is a criminal offence
    and any retrospective changes have to be clearly marked, dated and signed, and the reason for such changes
    clearly documented. However, today, it is very easy to alter information without it being noticed.</p>


<b>1.6 - Counterfeit drugs</b>


<p>The size of the global counterfeit drug market ranges between $75 to $200 billion and comprises of 50% of
    all drugs sold in low-income nations. It may contain inappropriate quantities of active ingredients (or none
    at all), contain ingredients that are not on the label or be supplied with inaccurate packaging and
    labelling, putting the safety of the patient at risk.</p>


<p>The pharmaceutical supply chain is very complex as a consequence of decisions by the industry on how best to
    source and distribute their medicines in different markets. The supply chain complexity creates various
    factors that contribute to the problem of loss of system integrity. Integrity predictably fractures across
    international borders, and where production processes and supply involve a variety of intermediaries, or
    repackaging/relabelling and whereby the provenance is lost. Indeed, it is precisely this loss of information
    that creates the necessary holes in the system that are criminally exploited.</p>


<b>2 - How blockchain can be applied to the healthcare sector</b>


<p>The inefficiencies in EHR accessibility and storage stems from a lack of standardisation. There lies no
    singular platform where EHR can be streamlined in a homogenous format that can be easily accessed by all
    clinicians regardless of institution or OS (“Operating System”). Such a platform must ensure
    interoperability is secure, and that data cannot be tampered with. This is where blockchain can provide an
    answer, and where the properties of blockchain can have a dramatic impact within the healthcare sector.</p>


<b>2.1 - Improvements for patient care</b>


<p>An accessible, interoperable platform for storing patient data will necessarily benefit patient care.</p>


<p>Fundamentally, patients can be subject to more efficient and transparent healthcare. Firstly, patient
    history can be entered onto the blockchain (or data pointers and consent), whereby all clinicians can view a
    verified and homogenous version of patient data. Subsequent consultation minutes can be logged onto the
    blockchain, clinicians can enter and view an entire patient’s history on one single platform.</p>


<p>This prevents potential inconsistencies that arise from multiple copies of similar data-sets being recorded
    across various institutional databases. Since, all data (regardless of institution) is entered and stored on
    one universally accessible platform, this guarantees greater consistency with accuracy of patient data than
    with fragmented record systems currently used to store EHR.</p>


<p>Furthermore, creating an interoperable platform for clinicians to access EHR necessarily ensures more
    effective patient care. Since clinicians can see all previous consultations (e.g. which medication the
    patient is taking, which medication a patient has been prescribed and any additional notes taken by previous
    clinicians), a deeper understanding of a patient can be garnered compared to the ‘snapshot’ provided by
    current healthcare databases. With this platform, clinicians can ascertain more accurate diagnoses,
    prescribe more effective treatment methods, and ensure that such actions are performed quicker and more
    efficiently than relying on incumbent EHR platforms.</p>


<p>For example, say you are in an accident abroad and you need surgery. Utilising blockchain to create an
    interoperable system of data sharing, surgeons can access your healthcare records immediately, and see, for
    example, what blood type you are, if you’re allergic to any medication and any present ailments that may
    impact surgery. Under current EHR data storage systems, this information may only be retrieved from
    submitting a request to the relevant domestic health authority where you reside, and this bureaucratic delay
    can dramatically impair the quality of care patients can receive</p>


<p>This not only provides more effective medical treatment in situations where patient data is necessary in
    time-tight situations, but in general terms general such an overview is especially useful for patients who
    consult with multiple clinicians across various medical institutions (such as elderly or chronic disease
    patients).</p>


<b>2.2 - Improvements in security</b>


<p>Not only can blockchain improve accessibility (which instrumentally improves patient care), but the
    decentralised nature of blockchain and DLTs reduces the chance of systemic breaches with traditionally
    centralised information seen in incumbent healthcare systems (in 2015 alone there were 112 million
    healthcare data breaches worldwide due to hacking).</p>


<p>Current EHR systems are centralised on specific and identifiable databases. These centralised data points
    (referred to as ‘honey pots’) provide a clear fault point for hackers to target. As we saw with the NHS
    ransomware attack, a breach of a centralised database breaches every server that is connected to that
    centralised database.</p>


<p>DLT ensures that there lies no single fault point for data breaches. If a node is hacked, only the data
    within that node will be breached, and not the entire system, and this proves an exponentially more secure
    system than incumbent systems for storing EHR. Regardless of the inevitable improvements in patient care
    that arise with DLT and blockchain, merely from a security perspective incumbent systems are in desperate
    need of reform, and utilising blockchain for storing healthcare records can provide a solution to this
    worldwide problem.</p>


<p>Finally, since data entries onto the blockchain are time-stamped and immutable, the risk of unscrupulous
    parties attempting to alter medical data is significantly reduced, and those interested in clinical research
    can have greater trust in the validity of the results. Both the timestamps and immutability of blockchain
    applies to tracking and regulating pharmaceutical drugs. By regulating the Chain of Custody (CoC) through
    blockchain, all records and evidence relating to the production of a drug until its delivery can be
    monitored more effectively, and relevant parties can be more sure of the provenance of the pharmaceutical,
    and that it has not been tampered with during transit.</p>


<b>3 - Empirical implementation of blockchain in healthcare - case-study analysis</b>


<p>From a theoretical standpoint, blockchain appears to be a revolutionary force in the healthcare sector, and
    provides a platform that can significantly improve patient care and data security. But how is blockchain
    actually being implemented into the healthcare sector? What are the challenges that these firms face?</p>


<p>We have decided to analyse 3 very different empirical use-cases of blockchain within the healthcare sector
    that allows us to visualise the breadth of impact this technology can have within the healthcare sector.
    These are namely ‘Guardtime’ for storing EHR, Mediledger regarding chain of custody concerns for
    pharmaceuticals, and Robomed for utilising smart contracts to guarantee a standardised level of care for
    healthcare services.</p>


<b>3.1 - Guardtime</b>


<p>One of the issues in the healthcare industry is regarding the exchange of medical data between different
    healthcare providers. As most hospitals and clinics use their own systems to store this data, it is more
    likely to be incompatible with the systems used by other providers. Guardtime, a company using KSI (Keyless
    Signature Infrastructure) blockchain technology, aims to solve this issue. However, it is not limited to
    only the medical sector as it provides services for the defence, advertising, financial and Government
    sectors.</p>


<p>The technology used by Guardtime in its application to healthcare is mainly in protecting the data of health
    patients whilst ensuring that access is still granted to the appropriate persons. The data is not stored in
    the blockchain itself but uses the existing databases of the participants in the network for storage. Each
    data, which in this case would be the patient health records, is given a hash value that is
    cryptographically generated. The hash value does not give away the contents of the data it is meant to
    represent, it only acts as an identifier within the blockchain. This makes it so that the security of the
    data comes not from preventing any malicious intent but in acting as a ‘speed-camera’ to see who gained
    access to which data and what changes are made. This is particularly useful as it helps keep sensitive or
    private documents away from those who are not meant to have access to them.</p>


<p>This technology has already been applied in several different countries, even if in sectors unrelated to
    healthcare. Altheia, the Chinese partner of Guardtime received a Government contract to develop a similar
    system for a national patent registration platform. Estonia, had also used Guardtime in order to secure
    their government services, which includes their national healthcare plans. Guardtime’s partnership with
    Estonia’s Ministry of Health started from 2016 and is now used by every Estonian with their e-identity card.
    The fact that Guardtime could be used on a national scale implies that it is possible to further scale up
    the infrastructure to become a global method of securing and granting access to data. The repercussions
    imply that even if a patient needs urgent medical attention outside of their residential country, they are
    still able to do so without having to gather all their health records before-hand.</p>


<p>The main limitations of blockchain includes the lack of trust in the integrity of the infrastructure due to
    the recent crypto-currency frauds, as most people still associate this technology to cryptocurrencies like
    bitcoin, as well as the slow transaction speed as the number of large data transactions increases. These are
    solved by how the technology is used as the fact that no actual data, but merely hash values are stored on
    the blockchain. Despite the resolving of these two major issues, there may be other forms of unforeseen
    difficulties such as adapting each infrastructure to the regulations of different countries, or other
    technical difficulties, as blockchain is still in its infancy.</p>


<b> 3.2 - Mediledger</b>


<p>The pharmaceutical industry, which has a long and (unnecessarily) complex supply chain has been extensively
    afflicted by the issue of counterfeit drugs. The size of the global counterfeit drug market ranges between
    $75 to $200 billion and comprises of 50% of all drugs sold in low-income nations. The supply chain, which
    includes several intermediaries has fostered a system facilitating a loss of information and its
    exploitation. The safety of these medicines is dependent on trust between intermediaries and trust in the
    system which has so far been ineffective in preventing the growth of the counterfeit marker.</p>


<p>A collaborative project between Chronicled and TheLinkLab, MediLedger aims to use blockchain to resolve this
    issue. Blockchain may redefine the need for trust in the industry and reduce regulatory and cross-border
    cost. Mediledger uses Ethereum to help improve traceability of the products in the supply chain by keeping
    record of all transactions made as the drugs go through intermediaries. The employment of an immutable
    permissioned ledger and zero-knowledge proofs (possible through zk-SNARKs, a novel form of non-interactive
    zero-knowledge proofs) allows transaction data to be secure and verifies transactions as drugs move through
    the supply chain thus improving traceability and patient safety.. Transactions are verified and posted to a
    Node of the blockchain and verifies that they are successfully accepted.</p>


<p>The pilot project conducted by MediLedger has been reported to be successful, The system prevents
    counterfeit drugs from entering the market as it ensures that “only the authorised manufacturer of a
    particular product can provision their own serialised units on the blockchain”. It subsequently transfers
    the product between trading partners using Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) messages
    augmented with hashes and mathematical proof. This message is then validated by the trading partner and
    posts it to the blockchain. Efficacy of the prototype has been confirmed and companies such as Genentech,
    Pfizer, McKesson, Abbvie and AmensourceBergen are involved in its implementation. The immediate benefit is
    the fulfilment of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act which aims to tackle the counterfeit drug market.</p>


<p>Although MediLedger has set up a prototype which records and verifies drugs onto the blockchain, the
    technology is in its infancy and we are yet to see whether the pharmaceutical industry will provide the
    financials to allow the formation of such a network. Additionally although long term benefits will include
    improved inventory, enhances patient safety and cost-reduction, short-term costs and competition with other
    companies using blockchain in the industry, such as BlockRx (based on tokenisation) may put into question
    whether companies will be willing to fund this project leading to unlikelihood of sufficient adoption for it
    to be effective. However, MediLedger has big names such as Pfizer and Genentech involved and with increased
    interest in blockchain and the extent of the pharmaceutical industry we might see blockchain solutions
    saving the pharmaceutical industry billions of dollars, and more importantly, saving people’s lives.</p>


<b>3.3 - Robomed Network</b>


<p>A more unique application of blockchain in the healthcare sector is Robomed. Robomed utilises the Ethereum
    blockchain to connect patients and healthcare providers through smart contracts, ensuring greater
    accountability with patient care, and providing an accessible platform for patients and clinicians to value
    medical services. The service is especially useful for patients who pay privately for healthcare in
    developing countries with poor enforcement and regulation of healthcare standards.</p>


<p>A dedicated community of medical professionals sets clinical guidelines for how particular medical services
    must be performed. Patients utilise the Robomed network, and chose the service that they need from their
    relevant healthcare institution that operates on the Robomed Network. All transactions on the network are
    conducted through RBM tokens, with community guidelines implemented via smart contracts. When a patient
    agrees to a service at a particular institution through Robomed, RBM tokens are held in escrow until the
    treatment fulfils the specified guidelines that are attached to that form of treatment. To ensure dynamism
    and accountability with healthcare standards on the network, patients are rewarded with tokens for rating
    treatments, and likewise for healthcare professionals to provide insight and feedback on treatments as
    certain practices develop.</p>


<p>Robomed thus utilises smart contracts to ensure that industry monitored levels of healthcare are performed
    for various healthcare services. Robomed integrates the efficiency of interoperability (more so since
    incumbent EHR systems can be integrated with the dedicated Robomed Application Programming Interface) with
    an added layer of accountability to further develop and improve patient care, and there is clear interest in
    the project (Their ICO generated $14,140,000 in 2 months token sale). Robomed already have 20 clinics
    connected to their network in Russia and Dubai, have over 1.7 million clients using their network, and
    manage 2900 digitised clinical guidelines for treatments and procedures. With the lucrative market that is
    private healthcare, the Robomed network effectively validates participating clinics with a seal of approval
    on medical services, which generates greater revenue from increased demand for that clinic’s services, and a
    guaranteed level of care for the patient.</p>


<p>However, a key concern for adoption and scalability of the Robomed network lies with national healthcare
    standards. Although clinical guidelines are established via trustworthy healthcare professionals, different
    countries operate with varying levels healthcare standards. To force clinicians in e.g. Brazil to adhere to
    more developed western healthcare standards - where payment to those clinicians via smart contracts will
    only arise once those standards are met - prevents the adoption of the network amongst the key demographic
    of the Robomed network (namely healthcare institutions in developing countries). Realistically, Robomed must
    develop clinical guidelines based on the jurisdiction they intend to capitalise upon, and logistically this
    will require an enormous amount of cooperation with healthcare institutions and professionals within
    specific jurisdictions.</p>


<p>With the project in its infancy, although an appealing idea, the concept of developing greater medical care
    with blockchain is far from being realised. Despite these concerns, the development of Robomed in Dubai and
    Russia indicates the potential of the project, and one can speculate that as Robomed develops and expands
    its network over the coming years, more and more countries and jurisdictions can provide greater
    accountability and a greater level of care for patients in private healthcare.</p>


<b>4 - What does the future hold for blockchain in healthcare?</b>


<p>Throughout this article we have discussed both the theoretical potential of blockchain, and how actual
    enterprises are utilising the technology. But what does the future hold for blockchain in the healthcare
    sector? Despite the huge amount of potential considerations, we have chosen a few that we believe highlight
    some interesting developments in the realm of healthcare and blockchain.</p>


<b>4.1 - Privacy considerations?</b>


<p>We have seen that there are exciting use-cases of blockchain within this sector, yet there is still huge
    room for development from both implementation and regulatory standpoints. Despite the enormous investments
    in innovation, all too many efforts fail. One major reason is that regulation in healthcare is very complex
    and risk-averse. The health care sector has many stakeholders, each with their own agenda and substantial
    resources/power to influence policy and opinion. As possession of data has become very valuable for
    secondary research, it is unlikely that EHR providers are very willing to store their data. Therefore,
    enough stakeholders need to be incentivized to support the blockchain technology if it wants to succeed.</p>


<p>The fact that data cannot be modified or deleted once it has been put on the blockchain has troublesome
    consequences for how health care works today. First of all, patients have the right to be forgotten. This
    means that, on request of the patient, all personal data concerning him or her is erased (as seen in Article
    7 of the GDPR). However, this is practically not possible when this data is stored on the blockchain,
    thereby violating regulation. There is evidence of firms being compliant with incoming GDPR regulations
    (through storing only pointers and audit information on the blockchain and that allows relevant to access
    the information off chain), however only time will tell when assessing future compliance with privacy
    regulation laws.</p>


<p>Moreover blockchain technology has become popular because it is more secure than traditional technology.
    However, it is not safe from fraud and has become attractive targets for cybercriminals. Smart contracts
    especially are the favourite target of hackers as they suffer through the code used to create them being
    prone to bugs. The problem is not yet off track as current efforts to validate smart contracts are
    inadequate. Therefore more research is needed on how to find exploits and bugs in smart contract codes in an
    efficient and inexpensive manner.</p>


<b> 4.2 Empowering patients and the Internet of things (IoT)</b>


<p>With decentralised data that is accessible by verified users, a key demographic of this dispersion of data
    is the patient themselves. With the potential of healthcare platforms allowing patients to view and monitor
    their own healthcare data, we can see instances where patients have managed to monitor their own health
    status, resulting in lifesaving findings for their health.</p>


<p>For example, Steven Keating (a doctoral student at M.I.T) monitored his own health after a brain scan showed
    an abnormality. It was only through his vigilance with monitoring his own data (which led to him pushing his
    doctors to conduct an MRI) that they found a cancerous tumour in his brain, and were able to remove this
    tumour before serious repercussions afflicted him. Steve’s case provides insight in how allowing patients
    access to their data can provide a strong preventative force for medical ailments.</p>


<p>As vested agents in our own well-being, it will be interesting to see how our ability to interact with our
    health-data will lead to improvements in lifestyle, and our ability to spot diseases/injuries before they
    manifest into something more serious. Although we can already request to have our medical records sent to
    us, blockchain provides a more dynamic platform for regulating our own healthcare, and this concept is
    especially relevant when we consider how blockchain can interact with wearables and the IoT, and how this
    data can be integrated with our healthcare data. By virtue of empowering individuals with their healthcare
    data, individuals are incentivised to monitor their health more frequently. If blockchain could also allow
    the data from wearables such as e.g. heart rate/blood pressure monitors to be integrated with our healthcare
    records, this allows individuals to garner a better understanding of their overall wellbeing as they can
    better monitor their own healthcare, and will both incentivise better lifestyle choices and aid in catching
    and preventing diseases.</p>


<b>5 - Conclusion</b>


<p>The healthcare sector is truly an exciting area where blockchain can be implemented, and there is a real
    case of value that the technology can bring for the sector as a whole. There are far more applications of
    blockchain in healthcare, and many more considerations for the future that we could not include in this

    adoption of blockchain.</p>
