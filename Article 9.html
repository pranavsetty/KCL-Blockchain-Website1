            <h1>Blockchain-Based Solutions to Tackle the Age-old Problem of Scattered Medical Records</h1>
            <h4>March 17, 2018 </h4>

            <h4>Charmaine Mabarana</h4>



            <p>In a world where fast paced developments are occurring, the scattered management of medical data records
            seems to be an archaic problem that has been left behind in the whirlwind of technological advancements.<p>


            <p>The problem of patient medical records is based on the fact that different healthcare providers use
            different databases and systems to store patient records. There is no single integrated database between
            GPs, hospitals, and other healthcare providers on a national scale, let alone on a global scale as of yet.
            This is where the decentralised immutable aspects of Blockchain technology can be utilised to offer a
            solution to a global problem. Several companies have recognised this opportunity and have been steadily
            developing platforms which focus on improving the landscape of big data management in the medical sector.</p>


            <p>A prominent example of one such company is London-based Medicalchain, who raised over $24m in their ICO in
            February 2018. Following their successful ICO and backing from the Coinsillium accelerator, hyperledger, the
            NHS as well as a partnership with The Groves Medical Group for a pilot project in July 2018, the company is
                certainly setting a trend for a complete overhaul in healthcare data management.</p>


            <p>In addition to decentralising medical records, companies are looking into how patients can gain control of
            their own data, have access to it when and where they want in the form of a Dapp. This idea has already been
            conceptualised by Proof Work who introduced it at the Disrupt Berlin Startup Battlefield 2017. They aim to
            allow patients to contribute or sell their anonymised data, stored in their Decentralised Electronic Medical
                Record (DEMR) via contractual agreements with their health care provider.</p>


            <p>From a financial perspective, patient autonomy over data, coupled with a cryptocurrency linked to patient
            data sharing, could allow insurance companies to create incentives for patients to carry out certain tasks,
            such as tracking their blood pressure in return for payment with their coin. Proof Work aims to profit by
                taking a small percentage from data transfers/incentive based transactions made through their platforms.</p>


            <p>However, these projects do have obstacles to surpass. With previous efforts for health data tracking such as
            Microsoft HealthVault being pulled from the market, it highlights the need for sustainability in this
            sector. It is hoped that with the incentive of coin renumeration, patients will be more driven to maintain
                and share their records.</p>


            <p>In particular, the risk of data theft and hacking remains a top concern. In order to be viable and trusted,
            companies will have to comply to with HIPAA and GDPR privacy regulations. ProofWork for example have gained
            these approvals. Moreover, the highly sensitive nature of patient data and the idea of opening these records
            up, making them readily available for public use, is a highly controversial matter implicating ethical and
                privacy concerns.</p>


            <p>Designing a democratised system through the blockchain platform that allows individuals to self govern their
            data, and in the process profit and contribute to healthcare research seems like a holy grail project. With
            investments pouring into medical based blockchain ventures as well as the healthcare technology sector,
            access to unified decentralised medical records, autonomy over our medical data and even application of
            artificial intelligence to tailor healthcare services will all be within our reach, perhaps sooner than we
                expect.</p>
