                In Conversation with Violet Lim: Co-Founder and CEO of Viola.AI</h1>
            <h4>January 26, 2018 | Jun Ming Yong
            </h4>


            <p>Partners in love and partners in business</p>


            <p>What began as a university romance 18 years ago has developed into a thirteen-year long marriage and Asia’s
                first, and largest dating company.</p>


            <p>Meet Violet Lim and Jamie Lee, CEO of Viola.AI and Business Lead. Most would know them from Lunch Actually
            Group, Asia’s largest dating business that provides online dating, mobile dating, lunch dating and date
            coaching services. Their latest venture is Viola.AI, a blockchain based AI marketplace platform that
                utilises machine learning to help people find and sustain relationships.</p>


            <p>One of the major challenges for dating companies is that the more successful they are at helping people find
            love, the faster they lose their client base. However, Viola.AI is able to break the traditional
                date-company business model and help couples sustain stable relationships.</p>


            <b>So how does blockchain, AI and a marketplace facilitate dating?</b>


            <p>For one, Blockchain can create and maintain immutable records. One of the perennial challenges in the dating
            sphere is verification of a stranger’s identification. Blockchain solves this problem through real-ID and
                visual recognition. The days of love scams are over!</p>


            <p>The AI provides relationship advice and suggests goods and services that couples might need. This is
            especially useful for married couples as, in Asia, divorce-rates are rapidly increasing. A report from SCMP
            states that from 2006 to 2016, divorce figures doubled in China alone. The challenge here is that most
            couples with marital problems have difficulty seeking help. However, with Viola.AI they have a way to seek
            counselling and reach out to support groups. Viola.Al presents the development of a holistic platform that
                satisfies couples' relationship needs. Further information can be found on the team’s white paper.</p>


            <b>So, why tokenisation?</b> <p>The process of tokenisation involves more marketing and there is regulatory
            uncertainty in some respects. A company must appeal to a global audience for fundraising, which subsequently
            exposes them to more questions and scrutiny. Thus, interactive communication is required to build a
            community and foster support. For a team like Lunch Actually Group that was Venture Capital backed, the
            alternative of going for venture capital was always available. For Violet, taking the more unorthodox
            approach presented an opportunity to validate the existing demand for the service, whilst inviting the
                community to join the team on their journey.</p>


            <p>The couple’s mission is to help people find good relationships and facilitate their longevity. It appears
            that Viola.AI might be a potential solution.<p>


            <p>Valentine’s day is coming up! So, make sure you check out Viola.AI. Amongst its many uses, Blockchain can
            help you find love.</p>
