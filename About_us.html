<h1> Teams</h1>

<h3>KCL Blockchain is divided into four separate teams which all have a specific purpose within the society </h3>

        <div class="col-lg-9">
            <h4> The technology team focuses mainly on training highly skilled blockchain developers through weekly
                sessions where we focus on both the underlying technology behind blockchain and how this technology
                can be
                implemented in the industry. With the guidance of experts with diverse backgrounds within the
                blockchain
                community, we hope to create a highly competent team. In the future, we want to contribute to
                satisfy the
                high
                demand of blockchain developers that are in the community. In addition to this, we want to launch
                innovative,
                exciting and relevant projects of our own.</h4>

            <h4>


                The Industry Division focuses on how blockchain technology is being implemented globally across a
                multitude of industries. Every week we will assess a new industry – be it energy, or banking – and
                evaluate the application of Blockchain in these sectors. Our goal is simple: create weekly articles,
                and organise events that not only inform our audience about interesting new use-cases of blockchain,
                but also get them excited about this necessarily disruptive technology. This information will be
                published on our website where both students and professionals of all knowledge levels can view and
                understand our findings. We will also organise exciting events that will make you care about
                blockchain - from electric cars to identity verification, our events on blockchain’s impact on our
                world will both excite and intrigue even the most technologically-sceptic punter.</h4></div>

                The Governance & Legal Division focuses on the behind the scenes of governments and legislators on the
                considerations, debates and policies that arise regarding blockchain. Being a disruptive technology, we
                are at an exciting position to engage with both the public, corporations and governments. As a society,
                we have the ability to inform and educate ourselves and others on the varying positions that governments
                take regarding different uses of blockchain in society. Our division is open to anyone willing to
                research and educate themselves and others on the current and expanding world of regulation of new
