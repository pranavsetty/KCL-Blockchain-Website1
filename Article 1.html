    <h1>An Exploration of Cryptocurrency Start-ups: A Case Study of BitBay.market</h1>
    <h4>December 14, 2017 | Melissa Tranfield</h4>

<p>BitBay is a fairly young cryptocurrency exchange company; at under 7 years old it is within the start-up stage. Founded
in 2014 in Katowice, Poland and operational since 2015, it now consists of a varied and dedicated team, headed by David
Zembeckis, Lead Developer.


A crucial aim for young companies competing in the cryptocurrency sphere is to build trust with their clients, as the
first step towards becoming reliable and reputable. The provenance of phishing and other methods of spamming would-be
customers to gain their attention has diluted widespread public participation in the world of cryptocurrency exchange.
Thankfully, companies like BitBay have taken this advice on board and have begun to implement greater transparency in
their practices, not least by the presence of a Slack group which anyone can apply to join, a thriving Reddit community
    that allows input from all, and an active team that is eager to answer questions.</p>


<b>What makes Blockchain innovative?</b>

<p>All crypto start-ups need to ask themselves this question. Of course, they know the answer to it. But what aspect of it
do these companies have to focus on? How can they best attract willing users and investors who are not currently aware
of the impact Blockchain will have on society?


Ostensibly, the decentralised aspect of Blockchain is the most innovative aspect. Simply put, a Blockchain is a
database, but its decentralised nature and the fact that existing records within the blockchain cannot be altered,
renders it far superior to the traditional centralised system. In a centralised system, a hacker can easily gain access
to the main database, which can wreak havoc financially and legally. The implementation of Blockchain in some of our
service providers, such as the healthcare industry, would eliminate risk of this kind and protect the data of millions.
However, when marketing a cryptocurrency company, the focus must be on foregrounding what it can offer as a financial
service in the present and in the future. BitBay allows users to trade USD, ETH (Ethereum), PSN and EUR. It also allows
users to trade other goods and services, and serves as a smart contracting platform, distinguishing them from other
providers.


Data is an extremely valuable commodity in today’s world. The Blockchain database is protected by a set of rules. There
are rules for how new information can be added (irrevocably) to the chain, and it can be added by anyone that meets the
criteria for that particular blockchain. These rules control the mining of the coins.

The term mining was first used to describe the process of acquiring Bitcoin, painting it as akin to gold mining. The
computer completes a certain amount of the work required to procure the bitcoin by solving code. When this has been
completed, the computer – or the miner – is allowed to make an entry to the database. A successful entry is rewarded
with Bitcoin. If this is done in accordance to the rules, the rest of the network will confirm it, and the transfer is
completed.


The blockchain is protected against anyone trying to change old data by the fact that each block also has information of
the previous block in it in the form of a ‘hash’. You cannot change a previous block without altering every block after
it. It also requires a lot of work and energy to input a change. This deters those attempting to alter past
transactions. Additionally, there is a finite number of coins in circulation. These factors make Blockchain transactions
    safe.</p>


<b>Bitcoin and Alt-coins</b>

<p>Bitcoin provided an unprecedented service in the mainstream market. Money could be transferred internationally in a
short amount of time with a very small fee. As Bitcoin became more valuable and more in demand, this price increased.


An ‘altcoin’ simply means an alternative coin to Bitcoin. Producers of new coins were intending to develop competitors
to Bitcoin and intended to innovate the current technology used in mining Bitcoin. To make it faster, more efficient,
anonymise it, distribute the coins more fairly. These improvements in the technology increased the value of alt-coins.
Some employed their coins as an incentive to acquire a particular service. In order to use a service, such as a bot, you
had to own a certain amount of a particular alt-coin. Blockchain has also been combined with other technology like cloud
storage with great results.


Bitcoin is open source; it is accessible and people can improve it. If all code was kept secret, this would hinder the
progress of developing Blockchain technology and not provide transparency for clients. However, this can create risk and
    increase and likelihood of forgery.</p>


<b>Cryptocurrencies and modern attitudes</b>

<p>The cryptocurrency sphere was more merit-based at the start. The market cap of a coin would be based mostly on the
quality of its technology. The coins’ efficiency and potential was represented in the price. This is no longer the case,
as market cap is often manipulated by users who are only seeking to make a profit and have little qualms regarding the
scamming of clients. They are in 2 main groups: ‘Whales’ have the majority of coins and can therefore freely increase
the price. ‘Shills’ try to promote a coin incessantly on crypto forums and social media, and can lead new users astray
as to their true value. ‘Fudding’ is also very common: the spreading of fear, uncertainty and doubt in order to push a
coin’s price down so it could be bought cheap, then shilled. Cryptocurrency is not formally regulated yet, so whales and
    shills have been able to manipulate users with abandon.</p>

    <b>What distinguishes BitBay from others?</b>

<p>BitBay, unlike Bitcoin, is not open-sourced; this is crucial as it operates on a proof-of-stake basis as opposed to a
proof-of-work one. The risks present in open sourcing in cryptocurrency are numerous, and can lead to cloning of the
coin and pumping it – spreading fake news about the value of a coin, driving the price up by misleading users and
allowing original stakeholders/founders to profit. BitBay is more obfuscated than Bitcoin and requires a very high
knowledge of programming in order to input changes. Proof-of-work coins, like Bitcoin, require proof that some sort of
work has taken place; miners must complete this work before any of their blocks are accepted by others. On the other
hand, the proof-of-stake algorithm only allows users who have a high stake in the currency to move on to, or create the
next block. Stakeholders are allocated randomly, but there is a risk present that one party could gain a monopoly.


BitBay’s unique composition and belief in improving the technology of their service rather than being purely
economically motivated is what sets them apart. It is unfortunate that the majority of new projects in the crypto space
aim to drive profit than actually develop the technology and implement it in areas apart from finance.


How do we bring cryptocurrency back to its former exalted status: an environment for people who love the technology, are
game-changers and wish to disrupt existing mechanisms for the benefit of future generations? To be explored in a future
