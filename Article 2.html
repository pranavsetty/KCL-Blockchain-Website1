            <h1>Blockchain's digital identities: Reclaiming your right to privacy</h1>
            <h4>December 14, 2017 | Beatrice Zanardi</h4>

            <p>Blockchain was first created to track bitcoin ownership, but since then it has been applied within various
            use cases to track pretty much anything that represents value. Through the distributed ledger concept,
            blockchain solutions offer the promise of a record that is immutable and therefore can be trusted. One of
            the non-financial use cases that has started to gather most traction by leveraging this technology have been
            identity applications such as IDs, passports, online account log-ins, birth certificates…etc. Applications
            range from offering greater peace of mind to individuals regarding the privacy of and control over their
            identity to empowering developing countries' citizens with greater access to human rights and the global
                economy through digital citizenship.</p>


           <p> Governments and corporations have been granting passports, driving licenses and social security numbers and
            blessing them with identity representation for centuries. The problem with this physical system of
            identification is that as easily as it is created, a personal identity can be revoked by your government or
            invalidated if you are in another country where such ID is not recognised. In general, we are being forced
            to give a variety of information about ourselves to prove that we are who we say we are when crossing a
            border, accessing an online service or buying a drink. The approach here is that if our identity were on the
            blockchain we would have more control over it, presenting the minimum information needed for a specific
            identification, having a greater control of our privacy and being less vulnerable to hacks.</p>


            <p>It might seem trivial, but do you ever wonder why a bouncer at a club should be able to see your name and
            nationality while checking for your age? – Apply this type of reasoning to an ever-growing digital world in
            which all your data (medical records, pictures, conversations…) is in hackable format and is being guarded
            as part of your identity by third parties, be it Facebook, Equifax, or the bouncer that knows your name and
                nationality apart from your age, and you will quickly recognise the need for self-sovereign identity.</p>


           <p> Jerry Cuomo, IBM's VP of Blockchain Technologies, explains the concept of self-sovereign identity: 'Imagine
            a world in which you always have peace of mind that your personal information is safe. Imagine a world in
            which your information cannot be shared without your clear, explicit consent at the time of the transaction;
            where you decide who can access what information, when, and for how long. In this world, you can even later
            choose to revoke that privilege. You are in control. Every person, organisation, or thing can have its own
            truly-independent digital identity that no other person, company, or government can take away.' </p>


            <p>Well, this vision is already taking place in the city of Zug, Switzerland, also known as Crypto Valley due
            to its high dedication to cryptocurrencies, where the first digital Zug ID was registered over the Ethereum
            blockchain last month. This will allow this city to unlock a range of government eServices like online
            voting and proof of residency, promoting greater trust between government agencies and citizens.</p>


            <p>Another example of moving towards a more private and controlled identity is being demonstrated by
            applications like Civic, who gives users the chance to create an account which collects various identifying
            information for them, verifies it with trusted third parties (e.g. governments), takes a cryptographic hash
            of all that information, inserts it into the public blockchain and erases the personal data from their
            servers. Whenever you need to identify yourself online with a service that is partnered with Civic, you will
            only give the necessary details for identification and this service will check it against the hash on the
            blockchain. All of this to say you will have given only the necessary information to identify yourself, no
            extra details like an email, and no one will need to store that information in their servers, keeping your
                identity safe and private.</p>


            <p>Apart from securing identity and managing it in a more privacy friendly manner, blockchain applications
            within this realm are starting to have a significant impact within creating verifiable identities for those
            who do not have a clear identification method due to humanitarian crisis situations. A clear example of this
            has been the use of blockchain by the Finnish government to help refugees from the Syrian crisis get on
            their feet faster. For the last two years the Finnish Immigration Service has been giving refugees without
            bank accounts prepaid Mastercards developed by MONI, a local start up. This card is linked to a unique
            digital identity stored on a blockchain, and therefore it can be used as a validated bank account, which
            until now was the main obstacle for asylum seekers missing a strongly authenticated identity to find a job
                and pay bills.</p>


            <p>The UN is also getting involved with blockchain technology to solve various issues under the 2030
            Sustainable Development Goal of providing legal identity for everyone on the planet. To date 1.1 billion
            worldwide live with no official identification, and the UN has teamed up with Accenture and Microsoft to
            start applying blockchain solutions, like the ones tested in Zug, to help individuals such as refugees prove
            who they are and gain access to basic services such as healthcare, education and financial services. Another
            example of the UN's involvement in blockchain based digital ID promotion has been to specifically tackle the
            increasing sex trafficking and forced labour rates in Moldova, where rural children with no official
                identification documents are at high risk of trafficking.</p>


            <p>Blockchain is taking the world by storm this year with most of the attention being directed towards Bitcoin
            as an investment opportunity, but this technology's use cases are much more than a cryptocurrency. Digital
            identity is one of the clearer opportunities that will continue to evolve over blockchain and has the chance
            to revolutionise the way data is treated, bringing back the power of privacy to individuals and generating
                an opportunity to connect to the global economy to over 1 billion unbanked people.</p>
