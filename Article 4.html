                What can the music industry learn from blockchain?</h1>
            <h4>December 14, 2017 | Kiera Finn-Oluonye
            </h4>


            <p>In 1997, financier David Pullman revolutionised the music industry with the introduction of Bowie Bond.
            These bonds were asset-backed securities of revenues of David Bowie’s 25 albums recorded prior to 1990.
            Bought for $55million by the Prudential Insurance Company of America, Bowie was able to use this lump sum to
            buy back his recordings from his former manager, with the guarantee that Prudential would receive the
                royalties for any future revenue of the 25 albums, for ten years.</p>


            <p>This tokenisation of Bowie’s music inspired Arie Levy-Cohen to create SingularDTV. Singular DTV is one of
            many entertainments based blockchain initiatives that are seeking to transform the music industry into a
            decentralised platform. As with Bowie Bond, Singular DTV aims to distribute music via tokenisation. Each
            artist launches a personalised token, which serves as intellectual property of the artist’s work.
                Contributors to the token launch are entitled to shares in the revenue generated by the artist.</p>


            <p>One artist already on board is New York based Slovenian DJ, Gramatik, who launched his token GRMTK via
            SingularDTV November 9th and accumulated 7500 Ether within 24 hours. Speaking to SIngularDTV, Gramatik said
            'I just want to release my own music whenever I want, on my own terms. I want to get rid of all that
            bureaucracy. I just want to make music. Living in a world that’s owned by banks and corporations, blockchain
                technology is pretty much the only thing that gives me hope for the future.'</p>


            <p>The potential for blockchain based entertainment platforms to cut out intermediary parties, allows these
            platforms to reinvent peer to peer (P2P) file sharing. The prevalence of Napster during the late 90s and
            early 2000s, introduced a new form of P2P distribution that allowed for music to be shared amongst
            music-lovers freely via MP3 files. The service revolutionised the industry but at the cost of record labels
                and artists. In 2001, Napster was shut down by the RIAA for violating copyright infringement laws.</p>


            <p>However, its potential remained. With the implementation of blockchain technology within the music industry,
            a similar form of P2P file sharing is merged with compensation for the artist and the various technicians
            and musicians who worked on their songs. Whilst Napster lead to the artist losing money, these blockchain
                based entertainment platforms plan to give back.</p>

            <p>Two-time Grammy award winner Imogen Heap’s project Mycelia For Music exemplifies this. Writing for Harvard
            Business Review, Heap hopes that blockchain technology 'holds the potential to give us a golden age of music
            not just for its listeners, but for those who make it, too.' For Heap, the introduction of a pioneering
            music ecosystem, means that all creatives who worked on the song or album can be compensated directly
                without distribution from a centralised 'middle-man'.</p>


            <p>In 2013, Heap released her song Tiny Human, with the help of music platform Ujo Music, via Ethereum. It
            became the first song to automatically compensate creatives involved in its production via Ethereum's smart
            contracts function. Whilst the requirement to purchase the song with Ether meant that the song did not
            generate a large amount of sales, it reaffirmed the potential for blockchain based technology to reinvent
                the music industry into one that compensates artists fairly.</p>


            <p>The future seems promising for these platforms. In recent years the digital music industry has propelled in
            popularity, with streaming services like Spotify, being embraced by artist and consumer alike. However, it
            still remains that royalty payments by these services to right holders remains low, meaning that
            streaming-only artists, like Chance the Rapper, are so unique and rare to come by in the industry. With
            streaming giants like Spotify and Apple Music compensating artists an average of $0.0038 to $0.0064 per
            play, new blockchain music based systems can embrace the digital music industry, whilst compensating artists
            directly from the consumption of their art. These platforms present a hope for artists, that maybe one day
                they’ll be able to have their cake and eat it too.</p>
